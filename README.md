## Credits for code history
This software is based on the code written by Massimo Burlando (alias massimo1220, https://github.com/massimo1220/lineRider-python3), \
who ported the code to Python 3 and improved it. Originally written by David Lu (Conundrumer, https://github.com/conundrumer).

This version aims at adding further functionalities to the game, made possible by first cleaning-up the code.
